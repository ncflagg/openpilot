No Toyota pedal support included

The VSR label (and description in my code comments) was a hypothesis at the time. Since then, many other hypotheses have emerged. Lately, I've been thinking the soft cog/deadband in the Prius steering system is the main culprit (and maybe imprecise steering angle data?) and that this old VSR logic improved things by reducing steering around center.
